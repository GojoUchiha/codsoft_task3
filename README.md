Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Portfolio! In this repository, 
you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. 
Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

Below is a summary of the projects:
Task_3 - CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION Description: 
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. 
Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn. 
I have used Logistic Regression.

I am grateful for the opportunity provided by CodSoft. I have learnt a lot from this experience and hope to use that to further my expertise!!!
